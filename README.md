[PgSTAC](https://github.com/stac-utils/pgstac) backend for [stac-fastapi](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-fastapi), the [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) implementation of the [STAC API spec](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec)

## Overview

**stac-fastapi-pgstac** is an HTTP interface built in FastAPI.
It validates requests and data sent to a [PgSTAC](https://github.com/stac-utils/pgstac) backend, and adds [links](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/item-spec/item-spec.md#link-object) to the returned data.
All other processing and search is provided directly using PgSTAC procedural sql / plpgsql functions on the database.
PgSTAC stores all collection and item records as jsonb fields exactly as they come in allowing for any custom fields to be stored and retrieved transparently.

## Usage

PgSTAC is an external project and may be used by multiple front ends.
For Stac FastAPI development, a Docker image (which is pulled as part of the docker-compose) is available via the [Github container registry](https://github.com/stac-utils/pgstac/pkgs/container/pgstac/81689794?tag=latest).
The PgSTAC version required by **stac-fastapi-pgstac** is found in the [setup](http://github.com/stac-utils/stac-fastapi-pgstac/blob/main/setup.py) file.

### Sorting

While the STAC [Sort Extension](https://github.com/stac-api-extensions/sort) is fully supported, [PgSTAC](https://github.com/stac-utils/pgstac) is particularly enhanced to be able to sort by datetime (either ascending or descending).
Sorting by anything other than datetime (the default if no sort is specified) on very large STAC repositories without very specific query limits (ie selecting a single day date range) will not have the same performance.
For more than millions of records it is recommended to either set a low connection timeout on PostgreSQL or to disable use of the Sort Extension.

### Hydration

To configure **stac-fastapi-pgstac** to [hydrate search result items in the API](https://stac-utils.github.io/pgstac/pgstac/#runtime-configurations), set the `USE_API_HYDRATE` environment variable to `true` or explicitly set the option in the PGStac Settings object.

### Migrations

There is a Python utility as part of PgSTAC ([pypgstac](https://stac-utils.github.io/pgstac/pypgstac/)) that includes a migration utility.
To use:

```shell
pypgstac migrate
```
